<h2 id="C1">Composition</h2>
<h4>Lyrics</h4>
<p>The songs are primarily about Swift's recurring themes of the emotions and reflections resulting from past romantic relationships. However, 1989 showcased a maturity in Swift's perspectives: Rolling Stone observed that the album was her first not to villainize ex-lovers, but instead expressed "wistful and nostalgic" viewpoints on broken romance. Pitchfork's Vrinda Jagota summarized 1989 as a "fully-realized fantasy of self-reliance, confidence, and ensuing pleasure", where Swift had ceased to dramatize failed relationships and learned to celebrate the moment.</p>
<h4>Music</h4>
<p>1989 recreated authentic 1980s pop sounds and made heavy use of synthesizers, programmed drums, pulsating basslines, and processed backing vocals to do so.</p>
