<h4>Lyrics</h4>
<p>Swift wrote Taylor Swift from her personal life experiences as a teenager. While she adhered to the confessional songwriting associated with country music, she did not write about stereotypical themes such as "tractors and hay bales because that's not really the way I grew up". She instead wrote about her observations and reflections on matters from romantic relationships to friendships, striving to convey her teenage perspectives as honestly and personally as possible. Because her inspirations came from immediate feelings and emotions, Swift wrote songs anytime and anywhere, from studio sessions to school breaks. The result is straightforward lyrics, which The Daily Telegraph noted to be <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/taylor-swifts-10-years-at-the-top-in-her-own-lyrics/">"brimmed with an earnest naiveté"</a>.</p>
<h4>Music</h4>
<p>Musically, Taylor Swift incorporates country music elements, including twang vocal delivery and acoustic instruments such as fiddles, guitars, and banjos. According to Rose, Chapman's production was a distinctive sound that was hard to categorize into a particular genre; Big Machine marketed the album to country radio regardless. Reviews from The Palm Beach Post and the Chicago Tribune categorized Taylor Swift as country music.</p>
