<h2 id="C1">Composition</h2>
<h4>Lyrics</h4>
<p>While the album's music transcends Swift's country roots, her storytelling ability, which was nurtured by her country background, remains intact in her songwriting. The album's title refers to what Swift termed the tumultuous, "red" emotions that were evoked by unhealthy romantic relationships she was experiencing during the album's conception phase. She described the emotions, which ranged "from intense love, intense frustration, jealousy, confusion", as extreme feelings where "there's nothing in between. There's nothing beige about any of those feelings". The lyrics discuss these feelings, describing a full range of emotional intensity.</p>
<h4>Music</h4>
<p>The final 16-track version of Red is a genre-spanning record, departing from the predominantly country-pop sound of Swift's previous albums.</p>

<h2 id="C2">Critical Reception</h2>
<p>Red generally received positive reviews from contemporary critics, most of whom commended Swift's songwriting. Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone called the album "a 16-song geyser of willful eclecticism", said Swift "often succeeds in joining the Joni [Mitchell]/Carole King tradition of stark-relief emotional mapping", and that "When she's really on, her songs are like tattoos". Pitchfork's Brad Nelson lauded the "newfound patience to Swift's observations" and deeper exploration of emotion in Red's songwriting.</p>
